# React Native Android Setup for Physical Device Testing

Ensure to Download Android Studio on Desktop and run commands through the terminal of a new project for this to work

## 1. Create a New React Native Project
```bash
    npx @react-native-community/cli init MyApp
    cd MyApp
Note: The old react-native init command is deprecated.

2. Configure Android SDK
Open Android Studio → SDK Manager → locate SDK path.

Create local.properties in MyApp/android/:

sdk.dir=PATH_TO_YOUR_ANDROID_SDK
Ensure the file is named exactly local.properties (no .txt).

Optionally, set ANDROID_HOME environment variable.

Common Issue: Build failed due to missing SDK.
Solution: Verified local.properties path and environment variable.

3. Connect Device & Verify ADB
Enable USB Debugging on your Android device.

bash
Copy code
adb devices
Device should appear in the list.

Common Issue: adb not recognized.
Solution: Add SDK platform-tools to PATH.

4. Build and Run App
bash
Copy code
cd android
.\gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
Metro bundler starts automatically.

App installs and opens on device.

Common Issue: Gradle version mismatch.
Solution: Updated gradle-wrapper.properties to Gradle 8.13.

5. Optional: Hot Reload
bash
Copy code
npx react-native start
Allows live updates to JS without rebuilding.

Notes

Replace MyApp and SDK paths with actual names.

Paths must be correct and free of hidden .txt extensions.

Base app is ready for adding features like touch tracking and overlays.
